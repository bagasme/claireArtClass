Claire had been in Mr. Sommers's art class all year. Some of her work had been 
 good. He had gicen her an A on her romance-book cover project. She got a C on 
 the children's book. (The story was better than the artwork.) She got a B+ on 
 the collage project. It took a little longer to grasp the idea of the collage 
 --- by the time she didn't have enough time to imagine something spectacular. 
 Still, though Claire had to work on her figure drawing, she was a better than 
 average student, with a solid B average in art class.

Natasha sat across from Claire in class. She had come into Mr. Sommers's class 
 late this year. Her family had come to America from eastern Europe. She spoke 
 little English. For the most part she did  exceptional work. But family 
 problems caused Natasha to miss at least one day of school during the week, 
 --- and often, that day was the same day as art class.
