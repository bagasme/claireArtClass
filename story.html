  <h1 class="title">Claire, Natasha, and Mr. Sommers's Art Class</h1>
   <article class="body">
    <p>
Claire had been in Mr. Sommers's art class all year. Some of her work had been 
 good. He had gicen her an A on her romance-book cover project. She got a C on 
 the children's book. (The story was better than the artwork.) She got a B+ on 
 the collage project. It took a little longer to grasp the idea of the collage 
 --- by the time she didn't have enough time to imagine something spectacular. 
 Still, though Claire had to work on her figure drawing, she was a better than 
 average student, with a solid B average in art class.
    </p>

    <p>
Natasha sat across from Claire in class. She had come into Mr. Sommers's class 
 late this year. Her family had come to America from eastern Europe. She spoke 
 little English. For the most part she did  exceptional work. But family 
 problems caused Natasha to miss at least one day of school during the week, 
 --- and often, that day was the same day as art class.

    <p>
For their final project, the class had to take an article from the newspaper 
 or a report from the television news and create a piece that used techniques 
 and mediums they had studied during the year. Claire got a B- on her project, 
 but it didn't affect her average that much: She was still a solid B student. 
 Natasha, however, finished with an A+ average.

Claire was beside herself. How could that be? Sure, the girl was a good 
 artist. But she was hardly ever there. Since she was absent, she had gotten 
 the assignment a week later than everyone else. It wasn't fair.
    </p>
    
    <p>
Every one of Claire's friends agreed that Mr. Sommers was being unfair. In 
 fact, Malik was ready to get a petition together for everyone to sign. But 
 Claire wanted to handle it on her own. She went to Mr. Sommers.

     <q>I don't think it's fair that you gave Natasha an A+ for this class. 
 She was out more than she was here, </q> Claire said.
    </p>

    <p>
     <q>Natasha is a very good artist, Claire,</q> he replied.
    </p>

    <p>
     <q> But she just got her assignment. Some of us worked really hard in 
 this class. You said back in September that attendance was a part of the 
 grade. Some of us were here every week. That should count for something.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
     <q>I think Natasha deserves an A+ and that's what I gave her. What's 
done is done.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
Claire wanted to say, <q>I think you should change her grade right now!</q>. 
 But instead she felt defeated.
    </p>

    <p>
Mr. Sommers continued, <q>What do you want me to do?</q>
    </p>

    <p>
     <q>Nothing,</q> she replied. <q>I just wanted to say, I don't think it's 
 fair.</q>
    </p>

    <p>
She picked up her portfolio and walked out of class.
    </p>

    <p>
The between-class rush swirled around her. Kids shouted to one another --- 
 where they were going to meet, what class was next, who just got a job. She 
 heard the slamming of lockers and the shriek of girls who got dates with cool 
 guys.
    </p>

    <p>
She walked past the cafetaria. Suddenly, she turned back and shoved her 
 portfolio into the huge garbage can by the door. Then a couple of jocks 
 tossed in the remains of their spaghetti-and-meatball lunch. Claire pushed 
 through the doors out to the commons, barely keeping back the tears. She sat 
 on a bench for a while, feeling sorry for herself. Then she went back to the 
 trash can and pulled out her portfolio with two fingers. She scraped it along 
 the edge of the garbage can and went into the cafetaria to get some napkins.
